# mcz Launcher

## Introduction

> Yet another Minecraft Launcher?

Yes! I wanted a simple minecraft Launcher for my Modpack that is cross platform, works with Minecraft 1.15 and specially with Forge.  
The given alternatives are:
  - Twitch Launcher  
    Sadly it doesn't work with Linux (my OS of choice). You would need run it through wine, which makes the game run through wine as well, unless you add a custom native Mojang Minecraft launcher profile. And that would defeat the purpose of a custom launcher.
  - MCUpdater  
    MCUpdater was my previous launcher of choice for this matter, but the Forge installer for 1.15 is bugged on my, and several other machines.
  - SK Launcher  
    Last commit is years ago, the official homepage blocks you out of it if you use an adblocker.
    
## Installation

You can either download and use one of the released launchers, or compile it yourself with the usual `gradlew build` commands.
